<p ><strong> jQuery</strong> 
 is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today.
 jQuery is free, open-source software licensed under the MIT License. jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications.
 jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. 
 This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets.
 The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and web applications.
